Fellow Consumer,"March 9, 2024","Great socket adaptors, make sure your devices are dual voltage 110/220v (most chargers and power cubes are) as these do not convert to 110v.

Jim,"January 11, 2024","Purchase 6 of these little guys, they worked perfectly in New Zealand. Their small size allows for both outlets of a wall receptacle to be accessible. And they support both 3-prong and 2-prong AC cords. They're small but not ""cheap"". Well made, will be using them on future travels for sure.

David Albert,"January 19, 2024","I used this adapter daily on a (nearly) 3-week trip to Sri Lanka which uses type G outlets and 230V/50Hz AC power.  The built-in USB charger was great; we used the USB-C output cable to charge my Google Pixel and one of the USB-A outputs to charge my wife's iPhone.  The LED indicators showing the power type (115VAC or 230VAC) were a nice touch that also shows if power is on at the outlet.  We were able to use our other devices (laptops, etc.) which have universal AC inputs with the USA type B AC outlets with no problems.  The carry bag was a nice touch and fit both this and a couple of extra plug adapters.This is one of the very few such devices with an independent test lab (ETL) compliance certification.  I do a lot of electronics design work and I am shocked (ahem) that so many AC-powered devices are lacking testing/certification by an NRTL (should show mark from one of: UL, ETL, TUV, MET, or CSA).  The testing/certification adds some cost, but for AC-powered devices, particularly with 230vac, I would not buy something that has not been independently safety tested. Don't be fooled by the myriad other markings on many devices (FCC, CE, etc.); those are not third-party safety testing. Kudos for Ceptics for doing the right thing!NOTE: the AC outlets on this (and most converters of this sort) just adapt the physical form factor of the plugs; they do NOT convert the voltage, so make sure whatever you plug into them is rated for use at the outlet voltage. If you are using it in a country with 230v power, do NOT plug in a device that is not rated for 230vac operation.  Many devices are now universal (95-235VAC 50/60 Hz) but not all of them are.  Read the acceptable voltage range on your device before plugging it in.  If your device is only rated for 115vac, it will likely be destroyed (possibly in a dangerous way) if you plug it in while the main outlet is supplying 230vac. There are converters that will also convert the voltage, but those are significantly larger, heavier, and more expensive...in almost all cases you're better off just traveling with appliances that support universal voltage and a plug adapter like this one.

ConstantReader,"March 18, 2024","We used these adaptors in multiple hotels and AirBnBs while traveling in several different countries.  They did the job, and were reasonably priced.  The only negative:  Each adaptor has two places to plug in your US/Canada cord.  The three-prong plug on the front worked fine.  However, after a few uses the top two-prong outlet stopped working.  It seemed to have lost its grip on the plug so that any wiggle from the cord disconnected the power.  This wasn't a big issue for us once we realized what was happening.  Again, the front plug never had a problem.

Mmmmm Fffff,"February 9, 2024","I bought two of these to take to visit the UK a few weeks back, and they worked really well! I made sure anything I plugged into them had the right voltage allowances so nothing would get ruined, and it worked well. One of the adapters was strictly for my CPAP machine. I have a Resmed Airsense 10 CPAP, and the power adapter that came with the CPAP was dual voltage so I didn't need a step-down UK adapter. I simply plugged the Ceptics adapter into the wall, plugged my CPAP adapter into it, and it worked fantastically! The two USB-C ports were used every night as well, one for my phone and the other for my power bank, and they both worked brilliantly. Overall, for the price, this was a solid investment that I can use again on future trips. Highly recommend.

Elsa Mou,"January 16, 2024","These adapter plugs are straightforward and robust, featuring a clean and attractive design. While they are not overly elaborate, their simplicity doesn't compromise functionality they work flawlessly. However, I have noted a slight issue with the fit in certain outlets, suggesting potential considerations for regional variations in socket designs despite the overall positive attributes of simplicity, sturdiness, and effective functionality of these adapter plugs.
